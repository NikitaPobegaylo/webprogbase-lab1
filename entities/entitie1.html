Time-wasters need to fall by the wayside, and serious grit-and-bear-it hard work needs to take its place.</p><p style="">The trick? Find a good time management system and work it. There are many. It's entirely up to you on which one to choose. But if you don't want to become part of the <a href="https://www.wanderlustworker.com/the-harvard-mba-business-school-study-on-goal-setting/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">92% statistic</a> of people who fail to achieve their long-term goals, then you need pay attention to how you use the precious little time you do have in this world.</p>
